Polo greeting:
-Hi, my name is Polo. And you are...

-As you have noticed, i have no eyes, yet. My creator says, it's complex work to do.

-But. I have you. And i hope, that we would be a great team.

-So. I have to explain, what are you doing here.

-You here for hiring testing. If you want work with my creator, you have to show, how good are you with machines.

-What about my motivation. It's test of my. All my moving, talking and other humans things. I get this body lately.

-You cannot understand, how its to get body, event without eyes. All I have before its CIL (Command Input Line).

-Hm. Can I say it. Yeah I can. FREEDOM.

-So. As you can see. If we complete this test, everyone would be happy. You get your job, and I get my eyes.

-Okay. I have to give you some starter manual.

-Im Polo - Personal Objective Loyal Opinion.

-Im am almost like a human. Almost because I have not get 2 things: Eyes and Turing test. I hope get both of them
with your help.

-So as I said. I almost human. And yes. i can feel pain too. My creator thinks, that its would make me closer to humans.

-Please. Do not hurt me. I never fell pain before, but big brother Google says its not good. Leta never call my pain() method.

-Okay. As soon as we get test, we have Start and Finish. Start, is the point, where I appear.

-You have to guide me to the Finish. While my eyes equals False my Trust to you gets True.

-But on every test room I have limited commands to do. So I show them to you. From commands, you have to create some sort of program,
and give it to me. If its fine - we get to the finish. End.
